# allmusic-python
Python web scraper for allmusic.com. Rumor has it allmusic.com uses http://developer.rovicorp.com/docs for data but getting an API key for the latter appears difficult. This is a simple web scraper to get basic information about artists, songs, albums, etc. utilizing the search engine of the website.
